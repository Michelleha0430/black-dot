       <h1>I consider black as the safest place and it has the most power embeded.
        <br> The density of the hue provides intense pressure that allows myself to be relaxed. 
        <br> The space resonates with my heartbeat, maintaining calmness unaffected by my emotions.
        <br> It opens a new quiet dimension with its silent movement.
        <br> The piece emulates the deepest area of the ocean inside me and represents the edge of my subconsciousness.
        <br> The color black provides the most comfort and freedom within my unconsciousness.
